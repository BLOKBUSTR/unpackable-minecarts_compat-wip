# Unpackable-Minecarts
This pack "returns" the original feature for chest/tnt/hopper/furnace/command block minecarts to drop the block and the minecart. To do this, this pack uses crafting to "return" this feature.

# Future Plans
Allow all boats with chest to be unpacked even though it's not necessary, it would be nice to have.
